            Hi, There,
            <br />
            It's me Nabin Dhital.
          </h2>
          <p>
            I am currently a student of Bsc. CSIT at Patan Multiple Campus and a
            Software Engineering Traine at Optimum Futurist. <br /> <br /> I
            {"â€™"}ve always been someone who has both a creative and a logical
            side. When I discovered web design in college, I realized it would
            be the perfect fit. I could use my creative side to design and my
            logical side to code. As a bonus, being both designer and developer
            allows me to make sure no detail is lost in translation.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </PageHeader>

              It's me Nabin Dhital.

          <p>
          I am currently a student of Bsc. CSIT at Patan Multiple Campus and a Software Engineering Traine at Optimum Futurist. <br />
          I{'â€™'}ve always been someone who has both a creative and a logical side. When I discovered web design in college, I realized it would be the perfect fit. I could use my creative side to design and my logical side to code. As a bonus, being both designer and developer allows me to make sure no detail is lost in translation.
